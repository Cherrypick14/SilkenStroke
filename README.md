# SilkenStroke
SilkenStroke is a little drawing app where you click to drop dots on the screen. When you press Enter, the dots turn into a smooth, curvy line — kind of like magic! It keeps getting smoother and smoother, then starts over again so you can watch it happen. It’s like watching your scribbles turn into pretty waves!
